                    <p>Hi! My name is Jhonny Lin, I was born and raised for the first 18 years of my life in Ecuador. I currently reside in Mississauga, Ontario. I have a degree on anthropology from University of Toronto. Currently, I am woring as a field archaeologist for ASI. I enjoy it a lot!
                    Some of my favorite hobbies are playing video games, watching anime and reading manga. Every year, I tend to go with my friends to the local anime conventions here in Toronto.
                    I am currently studying web development and design, because I am like learning more and I wish to expand my horizons. Possibly making a career change.
                    Well nice meeting you!
